<h3>Try Hack Me Open VPN</h3>
<p>Once again this part of the lab is easy, but there was a problem with the VPN service for a little while. 
I think I was opening and closing VPN and Server access to fast, and the VPN IP domain stop syncing with the Servers domain.
I was able to finish the lab. I downloaded it and installed and connected with Open VPN on Windows, and kali Linux. I
did these steps in the lab:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>Connecting to our network</li>
  <li>Connecting with Windows</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Check you're connected </li>
	</ul>
  <li>Learn about hacktivities</li>
  	<ul>
		<li>Connecting with Linux</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
