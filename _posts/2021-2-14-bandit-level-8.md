<h4>Commands of lab</h4>
<p>Connect to bandit.labs.overthewire.org using bandit7.</p>
<p>Ran "ls" found data.txt</p>
<p>read up on uniq and figured out that I would need to pipe to unuq -u</p>
<p>Ran command "cat data.txt | uniq -u"</p>
<p>I got back everything, so I found that I needed to run sort instead of cat</p>
<p>Ran " sort data.txt | uniq -u" and got PASSWORD</p>
