<h4>Commands of lab</h4>
<p>Connect to bandit.labs.overthewire.org using bandit9.</p>
<p>I Ran "ls" found data.txt</p>
<p>I Ran "cat data.txt | strings | grep ^=" and it did not give the password.</p>
<p>I checked a walkthough and he used the same command, and his worked.</p>
<p>I just used "cat data.txt | strings" to get all the text out of the file.</p>
<p>Found password "&========== truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk".</p>
<p>I am not sure why the command was not working for me.</p>
